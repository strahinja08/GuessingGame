# hello-world
My first repository, acctually its tutository.

I am creating this to makes muma proud. Everything for mama. Mama rules, mama the best. Mama mama mama. 
\Lets see if you can see and catch my phrase. 
BTW:
Each commit has an associated commit message, 
which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 
Commit messages capture the history of your changes, 
so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.
